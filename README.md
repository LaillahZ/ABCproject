# Sales Tax Project
Create a program that allows a user to input a price, and outputs the total price after the taxes shown
below.

Example: User enters 100. State tax would be $4, county tax would be $2, total tax would be $6 and
total sale amount would be $106.

## Project Instructions

[Follow these general instructions to fork and clone the project](https://ihccjava.github.io/docs/general-project-instructions/)

Inside your Main class and main method, write the code to do the following:
1. Take user input for price (should be stored as a double)
2. Calculate the state tax for the input price (assume state tax is 4%)
3. Calculate the county tax for the input price (assume county tax is 2%)
4. Calculate the total of both the state and county tax amounts
5. Calculate the total sale amount with the original price and taxes added
6. Output the following in a neat table format:
   - User input purchase price
   - State tax amount
   - County tax amount
   - Total sales tax amount
   - Total sale amount

### Rubric

Projects are graded on functionality (does it compile, can the user do what they are supposed to, and do they get the expected results). It is also graded on features added in the instructions, like including the correct methods, constructors, data conversions, and tests.
