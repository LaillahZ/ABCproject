# Sales Tax With Methods Project

This project will be to take the logic you did in
the previous sales tax project and split that logic into individual
methods. 

## Project Instructions

[Follow these general instructions to fork and clone the project](https://ihccjava.github.io/docs/general-project-instructions/)

Inside the Main class there are comments with what to name the methods, and which parameters to pass. This project utilizes tests I wrote that will validate your code. Make sure you follow
the instructions in the Main class closely to match method names exactly, or else these tests will not work.

Take the logic you made in the first Sales Tax project and place it into those newly created methods. The output of the program will be the same, but now your code is modularized better with methods. 

### Rubric

Projects are graded on functionality (does it compile, can the user do what they are supposed to, and do they get the expected results). It is also graded on features added in the instructions, like including the correct methods, constructors, data conversions, and tests.
