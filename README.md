# SalesTax
=======
# Sales Tax Project
Create a program that allows a user to input a price, and outputs the total price after the taxes shown
below.

Example: User enters 100. State tax would be $4, county tax would be $2, total tax would be $6 and
total sale amount would be $106.

# Sales Tax With Methods Project

This project will be to take the logic you did in
the previous sales tax project and split that logic into individual
methods.

## Project Instructions

[Follow these general instructions to fork and clone the project](https://ihccjava.github.io/docs/general-project-instructions/)

<<<<<<< HEAD
Inside your Main class and main method, write the code to do the following:
1. Take user input for price (should be stored as a double)
2. Calculate the state tax for the input price (assume state tax is 4%)
3. Calculate the county tax for the input price (assume county tax is 2%)
4. Calculate the total of both the state and county tax amounts
5. Calculate the total sale amount with the original price and taxes added
6. Output the following in a neat table format:
   - User input purchase price
   - State tax amount
   - County tax amount
   - Total sales tax amount
   - Total sale amount
=======
Inside the Main class there are comments with what to name the methods, and which parameters to pass. This project utilizes tests I wrote that will validate your code. Make sure you follow
the instructions in the Main class closely to match method names exactly, or else these tests will not work.

Take the logic you made in the first Sales Tax project and place it into those newly created methods. The output of the program will be the same, but now your code is modularized better with methods.

### Rubric

Projects are graded on functionality (does it compile, can the user do what they are supposed to, and do they get the expected results). It is also graded on features added in the instructions, like including the correct methods, constructors, data conversions, and tests.
